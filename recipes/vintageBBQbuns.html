    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the melted butter and the yeast mixture.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or
        until it doubles in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and divide it into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a bun and place them on a baking sheet
        lined with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the buns with a damp cloth and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg for a shiny finish.</li>
      <li>Bake the buns for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden brown.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
    </ol>
