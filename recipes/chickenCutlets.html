    <h3>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dredge each piece in the flour, shaking off any excess, then dip it

        Fry the cutlets for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Use a meat
